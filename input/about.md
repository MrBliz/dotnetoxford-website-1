Title: "About .NET Oxford"
---
.NET Oxford is a user-group based in the UK aimed at .NET developers. It's not _just_ .NET, but anything of interest to a .NET developer - which nowadays encompasses a _wide_ variety of topics! It was founded by [Dan Clarke](https://www.twitter.com/dracan) and [Matt Nield](https://www.twitter.com/mnield), and has grown into quite a large community in the Oxfordshire area.

Dan has written [quite in-depth blog posts](https://www.danclarke.com/tags/dotnetoxford) about all of our meetups for the first two years. Due to time constraints, he decided [to stop writing them](https://www.danclarke.com/stopping-dotnetoxford-writeups), and instead create this website to post more succinct _"meetup notes"_. So whilst this site includes _all_ meetups we've had - the first two years worth will mainly just link to Dan's blog post about that meetup.
