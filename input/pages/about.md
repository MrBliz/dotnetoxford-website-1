Title: "About .NET Oxford"
Order: 100
---
.NET Oxford is a user-group based in the UK aimed at .NET developers. It's not _just_ .NET, but anything of interest to a .NET developer - which nowadays encompasses a _wide_ variety of topics! It was founded by [Dan Clarke](https://www.twitter.com/dracan) and [Matt Nield](https://www.twitter.com/mnield), and has grown into quite a large community in the Oxfordshire area.

Dan has written [quite in-depth blog posts](https://www.danclarke.com/tags/dotnetoxford) about all of our meetups for the first two years, but due to time constraints, he decided [to stop writing them](https://www.danclarke.com/stopping-dotnetoxford-writeups), and instead create this website to post more succinct _"meetup notes"_. So whilst this site includes _all_ meetups we've had - the first two years worth will mainly just link to Dan's blog post about that meetup.

Our primary sponsor is [Corriculo Recruitment](https://corriculo.co.uk/). They have been our main sponsors from the very start, helping us out in so many different ways. Financially with the venue costs and providing drinks and refreshments for all our events. At each event, helping welcome everyone in through the doors and serving drinks. And also behind the scenes with marketing and promotion, ideas and suggestions. Definitely a core part of the .NET Oxford team!{style='float: left'}

### Everstack Ltd

### Photography

Whilst not _technically_ a sponsor - we'd also like to say a massive thank you to [John Parkin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnrparkin/) for his help with the photography. He's very kindly offered to help out with photography for each meetup - which is fantastic, as decent pictures of the events were something we were really lacking previously!
