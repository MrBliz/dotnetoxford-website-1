This month, Jon Skeet himself returned in what we're starting to term _'Skeetober'_! When he joined us last October, he spoke about C#8 ([link to blog post with full details](https://www.danclarke.com/dotnetoxford-october-2018.)). This time, he spoke about his new hobby drumkit project!

### Talk Description

_"Last summer I bought an electronic drum kit. I'm thoroughly enjoying playing it (badly) but I've spent even more time talking to the kit over a USB MIDI connection, in a C# application which allows you to load, edit and save the drum kit configuration. Personal projects are always fertile grounds for learning and reflecting, unburdened by deadlines and other external forces._

_This session will look at specific aspects of the code - particularly mutability and efficiency - but more importantly, we'll reflect together on the nature of personal projects and how we can use them to become more effective in our professional coding lives."_
