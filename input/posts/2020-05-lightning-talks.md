## "Writing Succinct C#" - Dan Clarke

_"With a lot of C# code I look at nowadays, I find myself thinking "wow, that could be made SO MUCH SMALLER!". Using LINQ, expression body members, null coalescing, ternary if, etc, etc. - most code can be made A LOT smaller! In this short talk, we'll explore a few examples."_

# "Pride & Prejudice & C#" - Simon Painter
_"Who doesn't like Jane Austen? She's kick-arse and awesome. The only problem though, is that she didn't write a great deal. Just 6 (ish) books? Not enough! In this talk, I'm going to show how, with a bit of C#, some relatively simple maths, and a bit of Blue-Peter-Style creativity, we can automatically generate as much Jane Austen as anyone in their right mind would ever want. I might even show you how this is useful in your day job as well!"_

# "How to ensure you have the right security headers" - Matt Nield
_"Security headers - loved by security teams and loathed by developers. They tell the consumers of your web application what to expect and what it can do. The question is, how can you ensure that your application has the right headers set? In this talk, I'll touch on the why, what, and how of setting security headers common to web applications."_

# "Feature Management in .NET" - Kev Smith
_"Feature flagging is not a new concept. For decades development teams have utilized this concept by wrapping a section of code with a targeted if/else statement, allowing them to control its release to their end-users. We'll take a look at how we can achieve this in .NET with the upcoming feature management libraries."_
