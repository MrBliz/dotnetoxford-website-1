# "TDD and the Terminator" with [Layla Porter](https://twitter.com/LaylaCodesIt)

_"Getting started with Test Driven Development (TDD) can be very challenging. It requires a different mindset and approach to writing and developing code. However, once in that mindset, it is very difficult not to write tests first._

_But why bother writing tests first?_

_In this session, we will go through the reasons for writing tests before coding, look at architecture and design principles, such as SOLID and see how it all comes together to create a more testable and maintainable application._

_I will show you how to get started writing tests first with practical examples on how to reprogram a T800 series Terminator so you can start using TDD in your own applications (or killer robots from the future)._

_Hasta La Vista badly-written code!"_
