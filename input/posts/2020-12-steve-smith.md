# Improving the Design of Existing Software - with [Steve 'Ardalis' Smith](https://twitter.com/ardalis)

_"Over time, software rots. If we’re not diligent, our beautiful code can degrade into a worthless mess. Keeping our code in working condition is no different than changing the oil in our car – it’s preventive maintenance. In this session, Steve will look at some common places to look for signs of degradation in existing applications, and steps to take to improve the code. Examples will use C#/.NET but are generally applicable regardless of platform."_
