_"With the releases of .NET Core 2.x, 3.x and now .NET 5, more developers have now got to grips with the basics of using the default Microsoft Dependency Injection container that comes with .NET Core. However, the story does not end there..._

_This talk will take you beyond the basics and cover more complex topics such as_

* _Avoiding unintended multiple registrations_
* _Conflicts between service lifetimes_
* _Understanding the Root and Scoped service providers_
* _Automated service registration packages_
* _Registering and resolving open generics, classes with multiple interfaces; and interfaces with multiple class implementation_
* _Integrating with other DI containers_
* _Key named registrations are not supported ... but I need it!_
* _Getting better startup performance from your registered services_
* _Thread safety and avoiding memory leaks_
* _Validating and unit testing your service registrations_

_The talk assumes that you have already had an initial dose of DI knowledge and are now ready for a top-up to avoid some nasty bugs."_
