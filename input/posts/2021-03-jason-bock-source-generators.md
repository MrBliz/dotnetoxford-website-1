# Talk Description

_"One of the features added in C# 9 is called "source generators", enabling a developer to create new code at compile time. This can be used for a myriad of cases, such as optimization, automating repetitive code, and dynamic API creation. In this session, Jason will cover how source generators work and demonstrate a number of implementations."_
