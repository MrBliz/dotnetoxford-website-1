# Talk Description

_"What started as a prototype in 2017 has become one of the hottest technologies in the .NET ecosystem. Blazor is Microsoft’s new front-end framework for building single page applications using C#, not JavaScript. That’s right, C# running in your browser. No plugins, transpilation or voodoo magic involved - just web standards._

_In this talk, you'll learn all about this game changing platform and how it brings choice back into front-end development._

_Starting from the beginning, you'll explore Blazor's flexible architecture and it's different rendering modes. You'll learn how C# code is able to run in the browser via a technology called WebAssembly. You'll also cover Blazor's component model, syntax, project types and more._

_By the end, you'll have a solid understanding of what Blazor is and how it could be the last framework you'll ever need!"_
