# Talk Description

_"The widespread adoption of WebAssembly, by all major browsers, has opened the world of front-end development to languages other than JavaScript. The platform leading the charge is Blazor - a new client-side UI framework from the Microsoft ASP.NET team. Blazor allows developers to write client-side applications using C# which runs inside the browser without needing plugins or transpilation - how cool is that!_

_In this code-focused session, we'll explore the Blazor platform. Starting with the fundamentals, we'll look at how to organise our applications for better maintainability. Then we'll look at how to handle user input using forms and validation. We'll then explore some more advanced topics such as JavaScript interop and authentication and authorisation._

_This session is great for developers both new to Blazor or who have prior experience and want to deepen their knowledge."_
