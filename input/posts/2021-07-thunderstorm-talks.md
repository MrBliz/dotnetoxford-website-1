_"Executing the very short development cycle of test-driven development requires discipline and practice._
_However, the .NET ecosystem offers us a wide variety of tools to support us in authoring a high-quality suite of unit tests, defending our production code against defects._
_In this short session, Stefan is showing how mutation testing can further improve the effectiveness of C# test suites by testing our unit tests with mutation testing, and how to continuously integrate it with Azure Pipelines/GitHub Actions._
_Let's kill some mutants!"_

Bio: Stefan's passion is to practice Clean Code and test-driven development in order to build maintainable software in an ever-evolving team, supported by tools from the .NET Ecosystem. He loves to attend and speak at public developer events and author open source projects, complementing my expertise in professional software development.

_"This talk is about the awesome [Spectre Console](https://github.com/spectreconsole/spectre.console) library, which puts your .NET console applications on steroids! With support for tables, charts, pretty exceptions, treeviews, images, and much more! The talk was initially going to be by the author, [Patrik Svensson](https://twitter.com/firstdrafthell) - but sadly he discovered a few days before that the cottage he was staying at didn't have wifi! So [Dan](https://twitter.com/dracan) decided to take his place, and rather than prep for the talk, treat it more of a live-stream where we explore and discover the library together during the session, and get the audience involved."_

Bio: Dan is a .NET and Azure developer and consultant, working for his own company, [Everstack](https://www.everstack.com/). A Microsoft MVP, founder and organiser of [.NET Oxford](https://dotnetoxford.com/), and host of [The Unhandled Exception](https://unhandledexceptionpodcast.com/) podcast. Also, proud father of two amazing boys, and husband to the best wife ever!
