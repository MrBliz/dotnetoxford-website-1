# Talk Description

In this session, we were joined by both Stephanie Yen and Alex Frankel to show us the new Azure Bicep!

_"Bicep is the future of declarative deployments for your Azure infrastructure. We'll go in-depth on why Bicep is important to deploy and manage your Azure infrastructure, how it advances the state of ARM Templates, and demo the benefits of Bicep vs ARM Templates and share the great capabilities it has!"_
