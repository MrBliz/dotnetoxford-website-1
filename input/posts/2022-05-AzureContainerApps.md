# Talk Description

_Meet the latest addition to Microsoft’s serverless offering – Azure Container Apps (ACA). Leverage scaling, resilience, and self-healing capabilities offered by Kubernetes without having the burden to manage and master Kubernetes itself. That’s the mission statement from Microsoft when it comes to ACA. But how does the new serverless runtime for containerized architectures work? What does it offer and what does not? And will developers be able to focus just on solving business requirements instead of taming the cloud infrastructure? Join this talk by Azure MVP and cloud-native enthusiast Thorsten Hans and get your questions answered._
