# Talk Description

_gRPC is Google's implementation of RPC. With .NET Core 3.0, gRPC has first-class support in .NET and seems to be the way forward for remote procedure calls. In my session, we will look at what gRPC is, and how to create a gRPC service and consume it. We will also discuss the four modes or methods of gRPC, versioning, and also talk about options when it comes to hosting gRPC services. That's not all! We will also discuss gRPC JSON transcoding, a feature that was so highly requested that it has made its way into .NET 7!_
