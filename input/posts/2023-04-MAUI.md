# Talk Description

_You may have heard the Buzz about .NET MAUI or maybe you have heard of Xamarin and all the monkeys but in this session we will cover..._

_What - What was Xamarin and now .NET MAUI and how can they help you develop Apps for your business/clients. And what the hell does MAUI stand for as it's not that nice sunny island we all want to go on holiday too..._

_How - How you as a .NET developer can use your existing .NET C# skills to develop and build Apps that run not just on the desktop but also on mobile platforms like the phone in your hand._

_Why - There are 5 Billion mobiles in use around the world split between the App Stores of iOS and Android but do you want to learn Java/Kotlin for Android and then Swift/ObjectiveC for iOS? Do you really want 2 separate codebases? No, of course, you don't! You're a .NET Developer, so let's use MAUI!_

_The session will show how to build a Mobile app how all the parts come together and how to deploy the App to the device in your pocket._

_We will show how to get the tooling set up and then how the Single Project is leveraged to run your C# code and using tools like Hot Reload we can live-debug on actual Mobile Devices._

_A fun session playing with Mobile Apps and for added geekery Aircraft facts and Figures because why not!_

# Video

Sadly, we had a tech failure on the night, so I'm afraid it wasn't recorded. The good news however - is that Clifford did the same talk at NDC last year, which can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt5Z9_3hf1U
