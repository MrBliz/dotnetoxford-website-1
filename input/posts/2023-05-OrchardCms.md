# Talk Description

_Are you developing .NET web apps and are tired of reinventing the wheel with every project? Use a modern foundation to build on instead! In this session, we'll do a quick dive into working with the modern ASP.NET Core framework and web content management system (CMS) [Orchard Core](https://www.orchardcore.net/). We'll see what Orchard can provide you, how it goes beyond simple content management, and why you'd want to join such a cutting-edge open-source community._
